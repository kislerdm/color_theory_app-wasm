# Color Theory App - WASM

Carnation of the [Color Theory App](https://github.com/kislerdm/color_theory_app) with two main differences:

- Logic is executed entirely on the client;
- Interface is implemented using vanila JS instead of ReactJS.

## Assets size minification

Total volume of assets data transferred to the client over the network is an important subject for optimisation.
